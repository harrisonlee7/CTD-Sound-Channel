# CTD-Sound-Channel

This code takes in 4 locations such as Oregon_shelf, Axial_base, Oregon_offshore and Oregon_slope and returns:
1. Average speed of sound for a focus location
2. Scatter plot showing the local maxima sound speed for all 4 locations
3. Sound Channel Dimensions (length and Width)

Also needs directory location for pickle files from OOIPY and an export directory
Export directory is because code outputs an excel file that contains the data for faster data access when reloading the same data.
